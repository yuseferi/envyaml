Storing application configuration in YAML files offers a clean and straightforward solution, but it's crucial to avoid exposing sensitive data like passwords and API keys. Environment variables provide a secure way to store secrets, preventing them from leaking into your codebase.

The **envyaml** package bridges this gap, allowing you to seamlessly integrate environment variables into your YAML configuration. No more plain-text secrets or complex workarounds! Simply reference environment variables within your YAML file using placeholders, and envyaml will handle the rest, securely substituting the values during parsing.

With **envyaml**, you can:

Keep your configuration clean and organized in YAML.
Protect sensitive data by storing it in environment variables.
Enjoy a simple and intuitive integration process.
No more compromising between convenience and security.  **envyaml** empowers you to manage your application configuration effectively while keeping your secrets safe.

### Installation:
    go get github.com/yuseferi/envyaml@latest

### Example:

#### sample 1: error on required env variable
```go
	type TestConfig struct {
		Host     string `yaml:"host" env:"TEST_HOST"`
		Port     int    `yaml:"port" env:"TEST_PORT"`
		Password string `yaml:"password" env:"TEST_PASSWORD,required"`
	}
	// Load the configuration
	var cfg TestConfig
	// assume your configs are in `config.yml` file and this is it's content
	//host: localhost
	//port: 3606
	//password: ${TEST_PASSWORD}
	err := envyaml.LoadConfig("config.yml", &cfg)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln(err)

	}
	fmt.Println(cfg)
```
Error `failed to parse environment variables: env: required environment variable "TEST_PASSWORD" is not set` is expected because this variable has not been set. 
let's create that env variable .

#### sample2: when env is defined
```go
	type TestConfig struct {
Host     string `yaml:"host" env:"TEST_HOST"`
Port     int    `yaml:"port" env:"TEST_PORT"`
Password string `yaml:"password" env:"TEST_PASSWORD,required"`
}
// Load the configuration
var cfg TestConfig
// assume your configs are in `config.yml` file and this is it's content
//host: localhost
//port: 3606
//password: ${TEST_PASSWORD}
_ = os.Setenv("TEST_PASSWORD", "envyaml_pass")
err := envyaml.LoadConfig("config.yml", &cfg)
if err != nil {
log.Fatalln(err)

}
fmt.Println(cfg)
```
and expected output would be 
```
{localhost 3606 envyaml_pass}
```
